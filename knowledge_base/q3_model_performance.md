- **P95 Response Time**: 185ms (30ms improvement vs Q2)
- **P99 Response Time**: 250ms (45ms improvement vs Q2)

### Throughput Metrics
- **Requests per Second**: 500 req/sec (+100 req/sec vs Q2)
- **Peak Throughput**: 750 req/sec during high traffic periods
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000 simultaneous users supported

## Key Improvements
1. Enhanced preprocessing pipeline reduced noise by 40%
2. Optimized neural network architecture improved efficiency
3. Better hyperparameter tuning resulted in more stable performance
4. Improved data quality from enhanced validation processes

## Model Comparison
The Q3 model outperforms the Q2 baseline across all metrics:
- Accuracy improvement: 94.2% vs 91.1%
- Latency reduction: 120ms vs 145ms average
- Throughput increase: 500 vs 400 req/sec

## Future Outlook
Based on current trends, we project Q4 accuracy to reach 95% with further latency optimizations targeting sub-100ms response times.
